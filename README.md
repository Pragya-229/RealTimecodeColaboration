The Real-Time Code Collaboration Tool provides a platform for developers to collaborate seamlessly on code in a synchronized environment. It supports real-time editing, commenting, and reviewing of code, making it an ideal tool for team projects.  

## Features
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Work on code together in real-time using WebSockets.  
- **Code Reviews**: Request and provide feedback on code changes.  
- **Version Control**: Track changes and revert to previous versions.  
- **User Registration and Profile Management**: Handled using Servlets and JSP.  
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Integration of JSP with Servlets for efficient UI management.  
- **Commenting System**: Add inline comments to specific code lines or changes.  
- **File Uploads**: Share files and assets seamlessly.  
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests for Service and DAO layers using JUnit and Mockito.  

## Technologies Used
